# Collective mpi tests
For the collective benchmarks we decided to use the allreduce, bcast, and gather tests as we have data for these from when these benchmarks were performed on Theta after it was built. [Said data is contained in this document.](https://cug.org/proceedings/cug2017_proceedings/includes/files/pap113s2-file1.pdf)

The links for the spreadsheets of the graphed results from the tests can be found at the following links:
